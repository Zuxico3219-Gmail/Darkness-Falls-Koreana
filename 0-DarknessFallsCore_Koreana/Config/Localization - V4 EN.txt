DFAnimals,"Animal husbandry is the art of caring for, and breeding animals. Since you have just found a baby animal, there are some basics that you need to know in order to become successful in breeding your own farm animals. First thing to note is that all animals need beds, food and water in order to survive. Haybales are good beds and water can be provided by simply digging a hole and filling it up with water. However, animals do consume water. Each type of animal also has a different type of food they eat, and it must be in the 'Animal Food Storage' box for them to find it. The food list is as follows.  Boar: Plant Fibers, Corn, Corn on the Cob. Goat: Plant Fibers, Corn, Corn on the Cob, Yucca. Sheep: Plant Fibers, Corn, Corn on the Cob, Yucca. Cow: Plant Fibers, Corn, Corn on the Cob, Yucca. Chicken: Corn, Corn Meal. Wolf: Raw Meat, Rotten Flesh.  The 'Animal Water Storage' box is used if you wish to have animals drink jars of water instead of just having a hole in the ground. Chickens also need a chicken nest in order to lay eggs for you. Other animals are primarily just a source of food, but wolves can be convinced to follow you and act as guards with a piece of raw meat."

tutorialTipQuest01_title,Welcome To Darkness Falls
tutorialTipQuest02,"No one expected the end of the world. Zombie movies, shows and games always portrayed it starting off with a few unwell people that just snowballed out of control. You remember the sky going dark and zombies bursting out of the sewer system.\n\nThen the military came. They tried to hold back the tides while people ran for evacuation. You remember falling, hitting your head and your world turning to darkness. Waking up, you heard gun fire and explosions, and your blurred vision eventually cleared to reveal a medical tent. Other survivors were around you, and you had been stripped to your undergarments to dress your wounds.\n\nOne of the other survivors explained this was a stopping point, a temporary safe zone until you could all be moved to the more permanent one, but it seemed the zombies found you first. You noticed the other survivors had backpacks of stuff, planning to make their escape, and one was passed to you. With no other plan, you snuck out of the camp with the other survivors, and then you all broke and ran in seperate directions so the zombies wouldn't notice you.\n\nNow, you have no memory, no clothes and no idea where you are. Maybe the backpack will have something of use?"
